- build-out commands
  - need to add character state awareness to limit what can be done (e.g. can't
    lie|sit|kneel|stand if already in said state)
  - add round-time
- add location entity and movement
  - consult location for characters at location
    - consult location for adjacent rooms
- make "LOGGER" configuration driven
